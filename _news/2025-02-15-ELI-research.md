title: Research on Pedagogical Utility of LLM Explanations

I am excited to share that we just submitted our research paper titled **"ELI-Why: Evaluating the Pedagogical Utility of LLM Explanations"** to ACL Rolling Review. In this work, we introduced **ELI-Why**, a benchmark to assess the pedagogical capabilities of LLMs, and we found that  inference-time instructions alone is insufficient for LLMs to produce high-utility explanations tailored to users' informational needs.
