Hi! I’m Keyu He, a Master of Intelligent Information Systems ([MIIS](https://miis.cs.cmu.edu/)) student at Carnegie Mellon University ([CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/)). Previously, I earned my B.S. from the University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)), where I double‑majored in **Computer Science** and **Applied & Computational Mathematics** and minored in **Artificial Intelligence Applications**.

Passionate about AI systems that can meaningfully interact with humans and enhance learning experiences. At CMU, I'm collaborating with PhD students [Qianou Ma](https://qianouma.com/en/about.html) and [Xuhui Zhou](https://xuhuiz.com/) on research in **socially intelligent AI and AI applications in education**. Previously at USC, I conducted NLP research as a member of the [INK Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/) and [DILL Lab](https://dill-lab.github.io/), under the guidance of Professors [Xiang Ren](https://www.seanre.com/) and [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/), with mentorship from [Brihi Joshi](https://brihijoshi.github.io/) and [Tejas Srinivasan](https://tejas1995.github.io/).

### Academic Achievements & Honors

- **USC Center for Undergraduate Research in Viterbi Engineering (CURVE) fellow**.
  - Fellowship awarded multiple times (Spring 2024 -- Spring 2025), with a total funding amount of $6,750.
- **USC Academic Achievement Award**: Fall 2022 - Fall 2024.
  - This award covered 11 units of tuition costs in total, amounting to approximately $24,000.
- **USC Dornsife Dean’s List & USC Viterbi Dean's List**: 2021-2025.
- **4th Place, USC Integral Bee Competition**: 2022.

### Current Research

- **Socially Intelligent AI**: Developing methods to find and generate datasets of AI social scenarios with verifiable rewards, then applying reinforcement learning to train models that improve their social interaction abilities.
- **AI for Education**: Creating AI-powered tools and assessment methods to evaluate users' prompt engineering skills and proficiency in "vibe programming" with large language models.

### Beyond Research

As a Course Producer and grader for multiple computer science and math courses, I’ve mentored peers and fostered inclusive learning environments.

Outside academics, I’ve led teams in competitions like the **Kaggle LLM-Prompt-Recovery Challenge**, earning a top-3.4% ranking globally.
