Hi! I am Keyu, a senior undergraduate student double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Applied & Computational Mathematics** at the University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)), with a minor in **Artificial Intelligence Applications**.

Passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), I’m fascinated by its potential to bridge communication gaps and foster understanding. I am currently working on NLP research as a member of the [INK Lab](https://inklab.usc.edu/) and [DILL Lab](https://dill-lab.github.io/), under the guidance of Professors [Xiang Ren](https://www.seanre.com/) and [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/), and the mentorship of [Brihi Joshi](https://brihijoshi.github.io/). My work focuses on **explainability and building user trust** in AI systems.

### Academic Achievements & Honors
- **USC Center for Undergraduate Research in Viterbi Engineering (CURVE) fellow**.
  - Fellowship awarded multiple times (Spring 2024, Summer 2024, and Fall 2024), with a total funding amount of $5,500.
- **USC Academic Achievement Award**: Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024, Fall 2024. 
  - This award covered 11 units of tuition costs in total, amounting to approximately $24,000.
- **USC Dornsife Dean’s List & USC Viterbi Dean's List**: 2021-2024.
- **4th Place, USC Integral Bee Competition**: 2022.

### Current Research
- **Explainable NLP Systems**: Collaborating on projects to align model-generated explanations with audience needs, emphasizing readability and cultural inclusivity.
- **Trust in Visual Language Models (VLMs)**: Designing metrics to evaluate explanation trustworthiness, especially for users with limited access to visual contexts.

### Beyond Research
As a Course Producer and grader for multiple computer science and math courses, I’ve mentored peers and fostered inclusive learning environments. 

Outside academics, I’ve led teams in competitions like the **Kaggle LLM-Prompt-Recovery Challenge**, earning a top-3.4% ranking globally.
